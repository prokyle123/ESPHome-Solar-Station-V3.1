# üåû Solar Station Project with ESPHome

## üåü Overview

Welcome to the Solar Station Project! This project harnesses the power of ESPHome and an ESP8266-based Wemos D1 Mini to monitor and control a solar station. It integrates a variety of sensors to measure and analyze environmental and operational data, providing a comprehensive view of your solar setup.

## üî• Features

- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Get real-time updates on ambient conditions using a DHT22 sensor.
- **Battery Temperature Monitoring**: Keep track of your battery's health with a Dallas temperature sensor.
- **Wind Speed Measurement**: Measure wind speed in mph using an ADC-based sensor.
- **WiFi Signal Strength**: Monitor the strength of your WiFi connection.
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Know how long your solar station has been running.
- **Battery Remaining Percentage**: Calculate the remaining battery life based on voltage levels.
- **Battery Usage**: Track how much battery power has been used over the last 6 hours.
- **Storm Prediction**: Get a heads-up on potential storms based on various environmental factors.
- **Battery Health Percentage**: Assess the health of your battery considering voltage and temperature.
- **Solar Panel Efficiency**: Measure how efficiently your solar panels are operating.
- **Air Quality Monitoring**: Monitor the levels of particulate matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10) in the air.
- **Solar Panel Power Output**: Check the power output of your solar panels.
- **Power Loss Due to Resistance**: Calculate power loss in the system due to resistance.
- **Indicator Light**: An addressable LED strip indicates air quality and battery charge status.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- **Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266)**: The main controller of the project.
- **DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**: Measures the ambient temperature and humidity.
- **Dallas Temperature Sensor**: Monitors the battery temperature.
- **ADC-based Wind Speed Sensor**: Measures the wind speed.
- **PMS5003 Air Quality Sensor**: Monitors particulate matter in the air.
- **INA219 Current Sensor**: Measures current and voltage from the solar panel and battery.
- **WS2812B Addressable LED Strip**: Provides visual indications for air quality and battery status.

## üñ•Ô∏è Software Requirements

- **ESPHome**: A system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 by simple yet powerful configuration files and control them remotely through Home Automation systems.
- **Home Assistant (optional)**: For integrating and visualizing the data from the solar station.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solarstation.git
   ```

2. **Configure ESPHome**: Install ESPHome on your machine and configure it to connect to your ESP8266 device. Use the provided YAML configuration file for ESPHome.

3. **Upload the Configuration**: Connect your Wemos D1 Mini to your computer via USB and upload the ESPHome configuration.
   ```bash
   esphome run solarstation.yaml
   ```

4. **Connect the Sensors**: Follow the hardware setup instructions to connect all the sensors to the Wemos D1 Mini.

5. **Monitor the Data**: Once everything is set up and running, you can monitor the data via the ESPHome dashboard or integrate it with Home Assistant for advanced visualization and automation.
